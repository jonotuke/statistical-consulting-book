    "text": "4.1 Why a project structure?\nSo welcome to the opinionated chapter on project structure. First a comment, I am not stating that this is the only way to organise a project, feel free to have your own system, as long as you have a system. This is my system as I write. It will change as I learn from my mistakes. What I want you to do is not follow it slavishly, but thing about the underlying principles and how you want to implement them.\nSo first the why. Why do you need a project structure? Well, as you become more experienced as a statistical consultant, then you will get more and more projects. This creates two problems:\nIn both cases, having a simple standard structure, means that you can get upto speed easily. This gives us stats consulting Rule 1\nIn the following, I will outline how to set up your folder stucture in R, and also guidance on why I use this structure.",

    "text": "4.2 Setting up a project stucture in R\nFirst we will set up the project using the usethis package:\n\nusethis::create_project(\"~/Desktop/2025-penguin-analysis\")\n\nSo a couple of things to notice, with my naming of the project, in this case\n2025-penguin-analysis\nFirst I have given the year that I did the analysis. This is useful, I have a massive archive of my previous analysis stored online, and it is often easiest to indentify when the analysis was done from previous emails with the collaborator. Once I have the year, then this reduces my search space. Next, I try to give it a memorable name to remind me of the analysis. In this case, we will assume that we are analysing the Palmer penguins dataset - this should be rememberable enough. I will also show you later how to add this info into your reports in Section 4.10.\nSo before we create any more of the structure, lets consider our goal- think self-contained (Figure 4.1). In the Kei-tora gardening contest, the contestents make a self-contained garden on the back of a trailer. Replace garden with analysis and trailer with folder. You should be able to send your folder to a colleague and they can reproduce your analysis. Nothing missing.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"figs\", \"kei-tora.png\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: The Kei-tora gardening contest\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now we are going to add some sub-folders for out analysis:\n\nfs::dir_create(\"raw-data\")\nfs::dir_create(\"data\")\n\nfs::dir_create(\"figs\")\nfs::dir_create(\"tabs\")\n\nfs::dir_create(\"r-code\")\n\nfs::dir_create(\"reports\")\n\nSo, let’s break down these subfolders.\nFirst, notice that I have two subfolders for data:\n\nraw-data, and\ndata.\n\nThe subfolder raw-data is for the data that I get from the collaborator - this is dated and named (Section 4.3) and is then left alone. I can read it into R, but I do not change it. I repeat: I. Do. Not. Change. It. You will be tempted, a quick adjustment will make your like easier. If you need to do this, then you change it, save the new file in the subfolder data and record what you did in your README file (more about this later Section 4.10). Our goal is to make our analysis reproducible and open - unrecorded tinkering of data is neither.\nThe subfolder data is for any data structure that you make yourself. While we are talking about data. Let’s talk about .RData:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRant 1: Stop using .RData\n\n\n\nDo not save .RData when you quit R and do not load .RData when you fire up R. The data you use in your analysis should be purposely loaded by you, not left as a side-effect.\n\n\nThe next two subfolders are figs and tabs. These are for all of the figures and tables from the analysis. I keep these seperate so that I can keep them easily, and also it makes it easy to share with the collaborators.\nSo now we get to some code file, these are put in the subfolder r-code. If I have python code, then we have a subfolder py-code, and a subfolder for julia: julia-code. I like to keep these seperate, but it is not necessary.\nThe next and final subfolder for now is reports. This is where I write my reports for the collaborator.\nNow we have some subfolders, we can now populate them with some files. So lets talk about naming files",
