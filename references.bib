  abstract = {In 1984, Cleveland suggested that statisticians have an important role in changing the use of graphics in science for the better. Thirty years later, we compared graphs published in top-rated applied science and statistics journals, evaluated for overall quality and against five principles of graphical excellence. Nearly 40\% of the 97 graphs we sampled were rated as poor, with no striking differences between the applied science and statistics graphs. Better use of graphs requires better definition of variables, units of measurement, scales, groups, and other graphical elements, and more routine use of grid lines on a ``standard'' set of graphical forms. Progress over the next 30~years needs to be supported by changes in software defaults.}

  abstract = {Visual displays of data in the parasitology literature are often presented in a way which is not very informative regarding the distribution of the data. An example being simple barcharts with half an error bar on top to display the distribution of parasitaemia and biomarkers of host immunity. Such displays obfuscate the shape of the data distribution through displaying too few statistical measures to explain the spread of all the data and selecting statistical measures which are influenced by skewness and outliers. We describe more informative, yet simple, visual representations of the data distribution commonly used in statistics and provide guidance with regards to the display of estimates of population parameters (e.g. population mean) and measures of precision (e.g. 95\% confidence interval) for statistical inference. In this article we focus on visual displays for numerical data and demonstrate such displays using an example dataset consisting of total IgG titres in response to three Plasmodium blood antigens measured in pregnant women and parasitaemia measurements from the same study. This tutorial aims to highlight the importance of displaying the data distribution appropriately and the role such displays have in selecting statistics to summarize its distribution and perform statistical inference.},
